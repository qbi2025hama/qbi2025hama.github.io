  <h2 class="heading-band">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	  Technologies for detecting and analyzing quantum beams—such as photons (including infrared, X-rays, gamma rays), electrons, neutrons, molecules, and ions—have contributed significantly to a wide range of disciplines from particle and nuclear physics to astrophysics, materials science, life sciences, and medicine. In recent years, imaging detection technologies in these fields have undergone dramatic advancements. At the same time, collaboration between science, engineering, industry, and academia has deepened, leading to rapid development across domains.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Against this backdrop, this workshop was launched with the aim of fostering interdisciplinary discussions centered on “Quantum Beam Imaging (QBI),” promoting the advancement of science and technology and the creation of new research fields. Through sharing the latest research and technologies and promoting interdisciplinary exchange, this workshop aims to encourage new ideas and collaborations.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Participants include young researchers such as graduate students, active researchers in various fields, and senior researchers leading research groups. We also welcome researchers from industry who are working toward practical applications.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Presentations are expected to share cutting-edge results and explore how principles and expertise from each field can be applied across disciplines. As the audience may include those with a general understanding of physical principles but not necessarily specialists in each topic, presenters are encouraged to include appropriate background information. If the topic has potential applications in other fields, please include a brief overview of such relevance.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We look forward to many exciting presentations and active participation. Outstanding student presentations will be recognized with an award.

  <h2 class="heading-band">Scope</h2>
	<p>
	  This workshop focuses on research and applied technologies related to Quantum Beam Imaging (QBI). Quantum beams include photons (infrared, visible, X-rays, gamma rays), electrons, neutrons, ions, and even molecules. Techniques for detecting and visualizing these beams play a crucial role across fields such as physics, materials science, life sciences, medicine, and engineering.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In particular, recent advances in imaging detectors (high sensitivity, high resolution, fast response), readout electronics, and data processing technologies have greatly accelerated developments in QBI. Additionally, robust implementation techniques such as radiation hardness, low power design, and integration are expanding the scope of industrial applications.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Imaging technologies using various quantum beams (X-rays, electron beams, neutron beams, ion beams, etc.)</li>
	<li>Design and development of imaging devices such as CMOS sensors, SOI sensors, and direct-conversion sensors</li>
	<li>Fast timing detection, pulse measurement, and Time-of-Flight (ToF) systems</li>
	<li>Spectral and multimodal imaging utilizing energy resolution</li>
	<li>Sensor implementation technologies such as radiation tolerance, cooling, large-area coverage, and 3D integration</li>
	<li>Applications in materials evaluation, biomedical imaging, medical diagnostics, space observation, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  The workshop encourages open discussion across disciplines and aims to spark new ideas and collaborative research. We welcome participation from young researchers and students. Outstanding student presentations will be awarded.

				<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
				Toward overcoming clinical problems of cancer treatments during surgery and endoscopic procedure, our group has established intraoperative rapid fluorescence imaging methods for various kinds of tumors, and discovered biomarker enzymatic activities that are characteristic of the cancer site of each patient. More concretely, by applying our library of fluorogenic probes to real clinical cancerous and normal fresh specimens, biomarker enzymatic activities for various tumors including lung, ovarian, esophageal, hepatic, pancreatic, and brain cancers have been successfully found out and identified. For example, a fluorogenic probe for DPP-4 was found to be effective for esophageal cancer, and now human phase II trial is undergoing in Japan.
				Furthermore, we recently started to establish novel cancer theranostics technologies by developing prodrug-type and radiotherapeutic anticancer drugs which will realize personalized and precision medicine based on the biomarker enzymatic activity of each patient. In this talk, the latest chemistry (chemical biology) and its medical applications to realize new theranostics for various types of cancers (chemical medicine) will be showcased.

				<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
				Quantum sensors, based on their underlying quantum science and technology, are anticipated to provide enhanced sensitivity and spatial resolution beyond that of current sensors. Among them, diamond has recently attracted significant interest as a quantum sensing platform due to its outstanding properties. For example, the electron spin of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond exhibits the longest spin coherence time (T₂) at room temperature among all solid-state electron spins. Remarkably, even a single spin can be observed at room temperature, greatly expanding the scope of applications in diverse fields such as life sciences. In addition, NV centers enable the measurement of not only magnetic fields but also electric fields, temperature, and pressure, making them highly versatile and sensitive quantum sensors with wide-ranging potential applications.
				Recent advances in the fabrication of diamond nanoparticles have further opened possibilities for biomedical applications. Moreover, ensemble systems utilizing large numbers of NV centers are expected to achieve extremely high sensitivity, enabling life science applications such as magnetoencephalography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), as well as fundamental physics experiments including dark matter searches.
				This presentation will introduce the basic principles of diamond quantum sensors, review recent progress, and discuss future prospects for their development and applications.
